## Dockerized Backend App with Database and Server
::: About
This repository contains a fully dockerized backend application, complete with a database and server. The project demonstrates how to containerize backend services, manage inter-container communication, and expose ports for seamless access both internally (within containers) and externally (from the host machine).
:::

### Project Overview
Purpose: Streamline the deployment and development of a backend application using Docker. The setup includes a backend server and a database, both containerized for portability and scalability.
Key Features:
- Dockerized backend server and database.

- Configured Docker networks for inter-container communication.

- Port mapping to access the services from outside the containerized environment.

## Technologies Used
- Docker: For containerizing the backend server and database.

- Backend Framework: [e.g., Express, Flask, Django] (Replace with your actual stack).

- Database: [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB] (Replace with your chosen DB).

- Docker Compose: To orchestrate multi-container applications.

## Key Highlights
* Port Mapping

* Exposes internal ports to the host machine for easy access to the backend API and database.

* Run and test the backend locally without manual environment setup.

* Containerized Database

* Deploy the database alongside the backend server, configured with environment variables for credentials.
